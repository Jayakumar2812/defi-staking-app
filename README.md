# De-fi Staking app
I have created to 2 ERC-20 Tokens.
* Main token Byetx(Byet) which has a supply of 16 million from the start.
* Reward token Reward(RWD) which also has the same supply.

I have created a place where you can stake the Byetx tokens(Byet) for a period of time to receive 5% of the total amount staked as rewards in terms of reward tokens(RWD).
I have  designed  and integrated front end using React js and Node js.
